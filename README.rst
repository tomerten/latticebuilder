Overview
========
This package contains a class for generating and editing accelerator lattice definitions.
It is mainly oriented at making my own work with lattices easier and my workflow more consistent, but maybe 
someone else can also use it.

Installation
============
.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U git+https://github.com/tomerten/latticebuilder.git
