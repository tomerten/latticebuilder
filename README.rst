Overview
========
This package contains a class for generating and editing accelerator lattice definitions.
It is mainly oriented at making my own work with lattices easier and my workflow more consistent, but maybe 
someone else can also use it.

Installation
============
.. code-block:: bash

    $ pip install -U git+https://github.com/tomerten/latticebuilder.git

Dependencies
============
The use of this package becomes only useful in combination with the package latticeadaptors, as this allows 
to convert the table generated by this package into lattice files that can be understood by the standard 
simulation tools MADX, ELEGANT and TRACY.
